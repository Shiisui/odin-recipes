    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>In Ancient Rome, there was a dish similar to a traditional lasagne called lasana or lasanum (Latin for 'container' or 'pot') described in the book De re coquinaria by Marcus Gavius Apicius

    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>

        <li>2 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>¼ cup marinara sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded low-fat mozzarella cheese</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>

        <li>Break each lasagna noodle into 6 rectangular pieces. Place noodles in a 4-cup microwave-safe bowl. Add water, making sure noodles are covered and water level is about halfway up the bowl. Place the bowl on a microwave-safe plate.

        </li>
        <li>Cook in the microwave on high for 2 minutes. Stir pasta quickly to keep it from clumping. Cook in 2-minute increments, stirring in between, and emptying any water that has boiled over onto the plate. Repeat until lasagna is tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes total. Drain noodles, reserving 1 tablespoon of the cooking liquid. Return noodles and reserved liquid to the bowl.

        </li>
        <li>Stir marinara sauce and chopped tomatoes into the bowl, mixing until incorporated. Sprinkle on basil, and then mozzarella cheese. Cover surface of the bowl with a paper towel to prevent splatter and microwave until cheese is completely melted and tomato sauce is warmed, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Serve immediately.
