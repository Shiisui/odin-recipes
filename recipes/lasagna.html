    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Lasagne
        are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also <br>
        refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as ragù <br>
        (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), <br>
        and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil. The dish may be topped<br> 
        with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically, cooked pasta is assembled with the other <br>
        ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting casserole is cut into single-serving square portions.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>

        <li>2 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>¼ cup marinara sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded low-fat mozzarella cheese</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>

        <li><p>Break each lasagna noodle into 6 rectangular pieces. Place noodles in a 4-cup microwave-safe bowl. Add water, making sure noodles are covered and water level is about halfway up the bowl. Place the bowl on a microwave-safe plate.

        </p>    </li>
        <li><p>Cook in the microwave on high for 2 minutes. Stir pasta quickly to keep it from clumping. Cook in 2-minute increments, stirring in between, and emptying any water that has boiled over onto the plate. Repeat until lasagna is tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes total. Drain noodles, reserving 1 tablespoon of the cooking liquid. Return noodles and reserved liquid to the bowl.

        </p> </li>
        <li><p>Stir marinara sauce and chopped tomatoes into the bowl, mixing until incorporated. Sprinkle on basil, and then mozzarella cheese. Cover surface of the bowl with a paper towel to prevent splatter and microwave until cheese is completely melted and tomato sauce is warmed, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Serve immediately.
